One reason is that access to affordable and clean energy is essential for economic development and poverty reduction. For example, energy is needed for businesses to operate, for people to cook and heat their homes, and for students to study.\n\nAnother reason is that access to affordable and clean energy can help to improve health outcomes. For example, it can help to reduce air pollution and the spread of disease.\n\nFinally, advancing SDG 7 can help to create jobs and reduce inequality. For example, the development of renewable energy projects can create jobs in the construction and engineering sectors.","Respondent":883,"Goal":"7","Interaction":"1","Respondent Token":"WY0OUZ"},{"Score":2,"Uncertain":1,"Comment":"\n\nThe two Sustainable Development Goals are inextricably linked. SDG 7 (Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all) is critical to achieving SDG 2 (End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture), as access to energy is essential for agricultural productivity, food security and nutrition. In sub-Saharan Africa, where over 60% of the population is engaged in agriculture, SDG 7 is particularly important.\n\nAccess to energy is a major challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the International Energy Agency, only around one-third of the population has access to electricity, and less than 10% have access to modern forms of energy such as natural gas, hydroelectricity","Respondent":883,"Goal":"7","Interaction":"2","Respondent Token":"WY0OUZ"},{"Score":2,"Uncertain":1,"Comment":"There are a number of reasons for this. First, SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) is critical for achieving SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) in sub-Saharan Africa. Lack of access to energy is a major barrier to healthcare in the region, as it limits the ability to power medical equipment and facilities. Second, SDG 7 also promotes economic growth, which is essential for achieving SDG 3. In sub-Saharan Africa, many people live in poverty and lack access to basic healthcare. Economic growth can help to improve healthcare access and outcomes by creating jobs and increasing incomes. Finally, SDG 7 also supports other SDGs, such as SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), which are also critical for achieving SDG 3 in sub-Saharan Africa.","Respondent":883,"Goal":"7","Interaction":"3","Respondent Token":"WY0OUZ"},{"Score":3,"Uncertain":1,"Comment":"There are a number of reasons why advancing SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) advances SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFirst, increasing access to affordable and clean energy helps to ensure that water pumps and other water infrastructure can be powered, which is essential for providing clean water to communities.\n\nSecond, clean energy can help to reduce air pollution, which is a major water contaminant in many parts of Africa.\n\nThird, expanding access to clean energy can create jobs and spur economic growth, which can in turn help to improve access to clean water and sanitation.\n\nFourth, increasing investment in clean energy can help to free up funds that can be used to invest in water and sanitation infrastructure.\n\nFinally, advancing SDG 7 can help to create a virtuous cycle of development, where access to clean energy leads to improved access to clean water and sanitation, which in turn leads to improved health and well-being, which creates more opportunities for economic growth, which leads to more investment in clean energy, and so on.","Respondent":883,"Goal":"7","Interaction":"6","Respondent Token":"WY0OUZ"},{"Score":3,"Uncertain":1,"Comment":"There are a number of reasons why advancing SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) advances SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFirst, increasing access to affordable and clean energy helps to create jobs and spur economic growth. For example, the expansion of renewable energy projects creates jobs in the construction and installation industries. In addition, increasing access to energy helps businesses to be more productive and efficient, leading to increased profits and growth.\n\nSecond, expanding access to affordable and clean energy helps to reduce poverty and inequality. For example, by providing households with access to clean cooking stoves, they can save money on fuel costs which can be used for other essential needs such as food and education. In addition, increasing access to energy helps to improve health and wellbeing, as well as providing opportunities for education and training.\n\nThird, promoting sustainable energy practices helps to protect the environment and combat climate change. For example, by investing in renewable energy projects, countries can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and help to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. In addition, sustainable energy practices can help to improve air quality and protect natural resources.","Respondent":883,"Goal":"7","Interaction":"8","Respondent Token":"WY0OUZ"},{"Score":0,"Uncertain":1,"Comment":"There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the relationship between SDG 7 and SDG 13 will vary depending on the specific context and priorities of each country in sub-Saharan Africa.

Without reliable and affordable electricity, businesses cannot operate effectively and families cannot heat their homes or cook meals.\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, only around one in four households have access to grid electricity (World Bank 2018). This leaves the vast majority of people relying on traditional biomass fuels such as wood and charcoal for cooking and heating. These fuels are often expensive, polluting and dangerous.

This can free up income that can be used instead to invest in renewable energy technologies. \n· Investing in infrastructure improvements such as piped sewer systems or latrines can create jobs during construction which boosts local economies. The money earned by workers can then be reinvested into other sectors including renewable energy. \n· Improving water management through activities like rainwater harvesting or constructing irrigation systems enables farmers to become more productive which increases incomes, food security, and resilience against climate shocks","Respondent":883,"Goal":"6","Interaction":"7","Respondent Token":"WY0OUZ"},{"Score":2,"Uncertain":1,"Comment":"Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most disadvantaged regions in the world when it comes to access to electricity. Only about a quarter of people in the region have access to reliable electricity, and many more are without any access at all.
